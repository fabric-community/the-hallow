# Spooky Time
Fabric Community mod for Hacktoberfest!

# Hacktoberfest
Hacktoberfest is a fun event that takes place every October which teaches people about open source (and helps them make their first contributions). If you make 4+ PRs from October 1st to October 31st, you'll get a fun tshirt! More information can be found on the [Hacktoberfest website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). Available loot can be found [here](https://hacktoberfestswaglist.com/).

# General
 Spooky Time is a Halloween themed community mod. If you have any spooky ideas, PR them! At the end of the month, we'll publish the mod to curseforge so everyone can play it. 
 
 # Style Guidelines
 When PRing to Fabric Community projects, we ask that you make an attempt to follow our style rules. A repo with more information [can be found here](https://github.com/fabric-community/style-guidelines). 

# Rules
 1. all contributions must be serious; no simple whitespace fixes or single character changes.
 2. large PRs (which is determined by the reviewer) will be merged in 1 day unless anyone comments. All other PRs will be merged instantly, given that they follow the other rules.
   2.1. PRs by repo maintainers must be reviewed & accepted by at least 1 other person.
 3. be serious; no 900,000 attack damage weapons or nukes that crash the game. The goal is to publish this mod and have it in modpacks!
 4. stay in the Halloween theme. As long as your idea is spooky, it's okay!
 5. be nice and be cool.
